Using machine learning to remove clouds from a video of the Aurora Borealis.

* Methodology

So vision transformers are meant for image classification. Time to learn a new technology! Let's start with a U-Net and work from there.

@TODO:
1. Go from videos to images
   - FFmpeg can do this: ~ffmpeg -i input.avi output_%3d.png~
   - Done (for now)
2. Get all of the data of clear skies, put them in a train directory, and prepare the images for training
3. Model to train
   - Includes two transforms in the dataloader:
     - one for clear data (i.e. it's unmodified) (done?), and
     - one for clouds (i.e. it's faking clouds over the same image) (Randy) (done)
4. A script to take a video, make it a bunch of images, then chunks(?), then enhance, then reverse the process
5. A . . . GUI?
